## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tournament detail — page shell
The tournament detail page SHALL carry a header holding the tournament's display name, a tab control, and a close control, in that order across the header.

The tab control SHALL offer a `Tournament` tab, always present, holding the information screen. It SHALL offer a second tab whenever the account holds a registration for that tournament or registration is available to it: labelled `Registered` when a registration is held — active, substituted, or cancelled — and `Register` when none is held and registration is available. When neither condition holds, the tab control SHALL offer the `Tournament` tab alone, and the reason registration is unavailable SHALL be stated on the information screen as it is today. The page SHALL open on the `Tournament` tab from every entry point.

Amending an existing registration SHALL open the amendment form on the `Registered` tab, in place of the registration it amends, and SHALL return to that registration when it is submitted or abandoned. No third tab SHALL be introduced for it.

The close control SHALL return to the list the page was opened from, and SHALL replace the page's back links: no "back to tournaments" link and no "back to information" link SHALL be rendered. The close control SHALL carry an accessible name naming the action, so it is not announced as an unlabelled glyph.

The page body SHALL scroll to its end whenever its content is taller than the space available, on both tabs. No part of the content SHALL be reachable only by resizing the window.

Sections on either tab SHALL be separated from one another by vertical space, so that no two bordered sections share or abut an edge.

The tournament's logo, where set, SHALL be presented at twice the size it is given on a list card and without a frame around it.

#### Scenario: Detail opens on the tournament tab
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a tournament from Fencer Home
- **THEN** the page shows the tournament name, a tab control resting on `Tournament`, and a close control, with the information screen below

#### Scenario: Register tab offered while registration is available
- **WHEN** a fencer without a registration opens a tournament whose registration is open and has an open slot
- **THEN** the tab control offers `Tournament` and `Register`, and selecting `Register` shows the registration form in place

#### Scenario: Tab reads Registered once a registration is held
- **WHEN** a fencer holding a reservation opens the same tournament
- **THEN** the second tab reads `Registered` and holds the registration, its state, and its actions

#### Scenario: Single tab when registration is impossible
- **WHEN** a fencer without a registration opens a tournament whose registration has closed
- **THEN** only the `Tournament` tab is offered and the information screen states that registration is closed

#### Scenario: Past tournament with a registration
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a past tournament from the Past tab where they held a paid registration
- **THEN** the `Registered` tab holds the read-only summary, and no register, payment, or cancel action is offered on either tab

#### Scenario: Returning to the information screen
- **WHEN** the fencer is on the `Register` or `Registered` tab
- **THEN** the `Tournament` tab returns them to the information screen without leaving the page

#### Scenario: Amending stays on the registered tab
- **WHEN** a fencer holding a reservation starts an amendment
- **THEN** the amendment form opens on the `Registered` tab, the tab control still shows two tabs, and submitting returns to the amended registration on that same tab

#### Scenario: Closing the page
- **WHEN** the fencer activates the close control
- **THEN** they return to the list the detail was opened from

#### Scenario: Long tournament read to the end
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a tournament whose information is taller than the window
- **THEN** the page scrolls and the last section is reachable

#### Scenario: Sections stand apart
- **WHEN** the information screen renders the header, disciplines, discounts, and other-actions sections
- **THEN** vertical space separates each from the next, with no two section borders touching

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tournament detail — information
The tournament detail page SHALL open, from the list, on an information screen that presents the tournament's full public information and does not itself contain the registration form. It SHALL show: name, subtitle when set, logo when set, date, location, organizer names, registration window, and three grouped sections. The disciplines section SHALL list each discipline by its name — never its slug (`discipline-identity`) — with its entry fee, its registered count as registered/capacity (or substitute-queue length when full), its optional when/where, and its optional ruleset shown as a short style name linking to the external ruleset document when a link is set. Several disciplines classified alike SHALL each be listed on their own line under their own name, with their own fee and their own count. A team discipline SHALL be listed in the same section, marked as a team event, with its per-team fee, its roster bounds, and its count stated in teams as entered/capacity (or waitlist length when full). When the tournament sets a team composition deadline and offers at least one team discipline, the deadline SHALL be stated in this section. The discounts section SHALL follow the disciplines section and SHALL list every discount the tournament configures, in configured order, each with its name, its condition stated as text, and its configured value — a fixed amount in each configured currency, or a percentage. The discounts section SHALL NOT show selection markers, since the information screen carries no selection, and SHALL be omitted entirely when the tournament configures no discounts. The other-actions section SHALL list non-purchasable activities — seminars, afterparties, after-sparrings, and accommodation — each with its optional when/where and remark. The information screen SHALL NOT mention gear lending or merch, and SHALL NOT show prices or quantity selectors for the other-actions section. When registration is available, it SHALL be reached through the page's `Register` tab rather than through a control on the information screen itself.

Where a discipline or an action carries any of its optional when/where/ruleset/remark text, that text SHALL be presented as a subordinate line beneath the row, one size down and in faded ink, with its parts separated by the spaced middle dot used elsewhere. The line SHALL NOT be introduced by a leading dash or any other bullet character: its indentation and weight already mark it as subordinate.

#### Scenario: Fencer reviews a tournament
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a tournament's detail from Fencer Home
- **THEN** they see the date, location, organizers, and each discipline under its name with its fee, registered/capacity count, and any when/where and ruleset link, on an information screen without the registration form

#### Scenario: Tiers listed separately
- **WHEN** a tournament offering two longsword disciplines with different capacities and fees is opened
- **THEN** both are listed on their own lines, each under its own name with its own fee and its own count

#### Scenario: Team discipline presented in teams
- **WHEN** a tournament offering a team discipline with capacity 8 and 5 teams entered is opened
- **THEN** that discipline is listed as a team event with its per-team fee, its roster bounds, and a count of 5/8 teams, alongside the composition deadline when one is set

#### Scenario: Detail line carries no leading dash
- **WHEN** a discipline with a when, a where and a ruleset is presented on the information screen
- **THEN** its subordinate line begins with the when value, with no dash, hyphen or bullet before it, and the three parts are separated by the spaced middle dot

#### Scenario: Discounts listed below the disciplines
- **WHEN** a fencer opens the information screen of a tournament offering −500 Kč for 2 disciplines and −10 % for early registration
- **THEN** a discounts section appears below the disciplines listing both, each with its name, the condition under which it applies, and its value, with no selection markers

#### Scenario: Discount values shown per configured currency
- **WHEN** the information screen of a CZK + EUR tournament lists a fixed discount configured as 500 Kč / 20 €
- **THEN** the row states both amounts, exactly as discipline and item prices are stated on the same screen

#### Scenario: No discounts, no section
- **WHEN** a fencer opens the information screen of a tournament that configures no discounts
- **THEN** no discounts section and no empty-state text appear

#### Scenario: Actions grouped without gear or merch
- **WHEN** the tournament offers a seminar and an afterparty alongside gear lending and merch items
- **THEN** the information screen lists the seminar and afterparty under other actions with their when/where and remark, and does not show gear lending, merch, prices, or quantity selectors

#### Scenario: Open Register from information
- **WHEN** the fencer views the information screen while registration is available
- **THEN** the page's `Register` tab is offered and opens the registration form, and the information screen itself carries no register button

### Requirement: Registration with live total
The Register screen SHALL be reached through the detail page's `Register` tab, offered only when the account has no active registration, registration is open, and at least one discipline or other purchasable item has an open slot. It SHALL present every purchasable item as one long list grouped into sections — tournament (disciplines), actions (seminars, afterparties, after-sparrings), gear lending (rentals), and merch & other — plus one non-billable field, a free-text note to the organizer. Each item SHALL offer selection or a quantity up to its limit. The displayed total SHALL be computed by the server pricing engine and refresh as the selection changes.

Below the purchasable items and above the total, the screen SHALL show a discounts section listing every discount the tournament configures, in configured order, each with its name, its configured value, and a read-only marker stating whether the current selection activates it. The marker states SHALL come from the server's pricing evaluation of the current selection, and the screen SHALL NOT evaluate discount conditions itself. The markers SHALL refresh with the total, from the same evaluation, so the section can never contradict the amount below it. WHEN no discount state is available for the current selection — nothing selected, or the price evaluation failed — every marker SHALL read as inactive rather than retain an earlier state. The section SHALL be omitted entirely when the tournament configures no discounts.

Submitting SHALL create the registration through the existing registration contract. WHEN a selected discipline is full, the screen SHALL surface the choice between trimming the selection and joining the substitute queue with the whole registration. On success the page SHALL move to the `Registered` tab, which thereafter holds the registration in place of the form.

#### Scenario: Register screen grouped by section
- **WHEN** the fencer opens the Register screen for a tournament with disciplines, a seminar, weapon rental, and a t-shirt
- **THEN** the items appear as one long list grouped into tournament, actions, gear lending, and merch & other sections, each selectable with a quantity up to its limit

#### Scenario: One non-billable field
- **WHEN** the fencer reaches the bottom of the Register screen
- **THEN** the only non-billable field offered is the free-text note, with no accommodation field and no after-sparring checkbox

#### Scenario: Register unavailable when nothing is open
- **WHEN** registration is closed, not yet open, or every discipline and item is full
- **THEN** no `Register` tab is offered on the detail page

#### Scenario: Total updates while selecting
- **WHEN** the fencer adds a second discipline that triggers a multi-discipline discount
- **THEN** the displayed total updates to the discounted amount computed by the server

#### Scenario: Markers follow the selection
- **WHEN** the fencer holds one discipline on a tournament offering −500 Kč for 2 disciplines and −200 Kč for 3, and then ticks a second discipline
- **THEN** the 2-discipline row becomes marked active, the 3-discipline row stays inactive, and the total drops by the discount in the same refresh

#### Scenario: Missed discount stays visible
- **WHEN** the fencer's selection activates no discount at all
- **THEN** every configured discount is still listed, all markers inactive, so the fencer can see what is on offer

#### Scenario: Markers cannot be operated
- **WHEN** the fencer clicks a discount row's marker
- **THEN** nothing changes: the marker reports the consequence of the selection above it and is not itself selectable

#### Scenario: Nothing selected
- **WHEN** the fencer has selected no discipline
- **THEN** the discounts section lists every discount with all markers inactive, beside a zero total

#### Scenario: Price evaluation unavailable
- **WHEN** the price evaluation for the current selection fails
- **THEN** the markers clear along with the total rather than leaving a previous selection's discounts marked active

#### Scenario: Successful registration from the screen
- **WHEN** the fencer submits a valid selection
- **THEN** a reservation is created and the page moves to the `Registered` tab, showing the registration with its payment instructions

#### Scenario: Full discipline choice
- **WHEN** the fencer submits a selection containing a full discipline
- **THEN** the screen presents the full disciplines and offers joining the substitute queue or removing them before resubmitting
