## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tournament detail — information
The tournament detail page SHALL open, from the list, on an information screen that presents the tournament's full public information and does not itself contain the registration form. It SHALL open with the tournament's identity stated as consecutive lines in this order: the title; the subtitle when set; the date, the location and the qualification statement on one line; the registration opening moment and closing date on one line; the titular organizers; and the description. Parts sharing a line SHALL be separated by the spaced middle dot, and a line whose every part is absent SHALL be omitted rather than left blank. The logo, when set, stands beside these lines.

The opening moment SHALL be stated with its time of day whenever the tournament sets one, and with the zone that time is stated in. Where the tournament sets no opening time, the opening SHALL be stated as a date alone exactly as before, with no invented hour and no zone.

Below them the screen SHALL show three grouped sections. The disciplines section SHALL list each discipline by its name — never its slug (`discipline-identity`) — with its entry fee, its registered count as registered/capacity (or substitute-queue length when full), its optional when/where, and its optional ruleset rendered as an inline markdown field (`organizer-prose`), so that a ruleset naming versions in more than one language presents each version as its own link. Several disciplines classified alike SHALL each be listed on their own line under their own name, with their own fee and their own count. A team discipline SHALL be listed in the same section, marked as a team event, with its per-team fee, its roster bounds, and its count stated in teams as entered/capacity (or waitlist length when full); the team-event marker SHALL be set off from the discipline's name by horizontal space rather than sitting flush against it. When the tournament sets a team composition deadline and offers at least one team discipline, the deadline SHALL be stated in this section. The discounts section SHALL follow the disciplines section and SHALL list every discount the tournament configures, in configured order, each with its name, its condition stated as text, and its configured value — a fixed amount in each configured currency, or a percentage. The discounts section SHALL NOT show selection markers, since the information screen carries no selection, and SHALL be omitted entirely when the tournament configures no discounts. The other-actions section SHALL list non-purchasable activities — seminars, afterparties, after-sparrings, and accommodation — each with its optional when/where and remark. The information screen SHALL NOT mention gear lending or merch, and SHALL NOT show prices or quantity selectors for the other-actions section. When registration is available, it SHALL be reached through the page's `Register` tab rather than through a control on the information screen itself.

Where a discipline or an action carries any of its optional when/where/ruleset/remark text, that text SHALL be presented as a subordinate line beneath the row, one size down and in faded ink, with its parts separated by the spaced middle dot used elsewhere. The line SHALL NOT be introduced by a leading dash or any other bullet character: its indentation and weight already mark it as subordinate.

#### Scenario: Fencer reviews a tournament
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a tournament's detail from Fencer Home
- **THEN** they read the title, the subtitle, the date · place · qualification line, the registration window line, the organizers and the description in that order, followed by each discipline under its name with its fee, registered/capacity count, and any when/where and ruleset

- **THEN** the line states the date alone, with no time and no zone

#### Scenario: Team marker set off from the name
- **WHEN** a team discipline is listed

- **THEN** its subordinate line begins with the when value, with no dash, hyphen or bullet before it, and the three parts are separated by the spaced middle dot

#### Scenario: Rules in two languages
- **WHEN** a discipline's ruleset reads `[Barbasetti Right of Way](https://example.com/cz.pdf) (CZ) · [EN](https://example.com/en.pdf)`
- **THEN** the subordinate line presents the ruleset label followed by both names as separate links to their own documents, with no markup characters visible, and the label itself is not a link

#### Scenario: Ruleset without a link
- **WHEN** a discipline's ruleset reads `Right of Way` with no link syntax
- **THEN** it is presented as plain text after the ruleset label, exactly as it was before the field accepted markdown

#### Scenario: Discounts listed below the disciplines
- **WHEN** a fencer opens the information screen of a tournament offering −500 Kč for 2 disciplines and −10 % for early registration
- **THEN** a discounts section appears below the disciplines listing both, each with its name, the condition under which it applies, and its value, with no selection markers

#### Scenario: Discount values shown per configured currency
- **WHEN** the information screen of a CZK + EUR tournament lists a fixed discount configured as 500 Kč / 20 €

#### Scenario: Open Register from information
- **WHEN** the fencer views the information screen while registration is available
