## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Fencer Home landing
Every logged-in account SHALL land on the Fencer Home page after login. The page SHALL be a full-screen console-style view with a top bar and a tournament list, filtered by three disjoint tabs: Otevřené turnaje (Open — published, non-cancelled, upcoming tournaments whose registration is open right now), Vyhlášené turnaje (Announced — published, non-cancelled, upcoming tournaments whose registration is not open: not yet opened or already closed), and Proběhlé turnaje (Past — the fencer's own history). "Published" means the tournament carries a publication record, not that its setup happens to be complete. The Open tab SHALL be selected after login. Upcoming tournaments SHALL be ordered by date ascending and each card SHALL show: the tournament logo on the left when one is set, the tournament name, the subtitle beneath the name when one is set, organizer names, date, location, the offered disciplines with registered numbers as taken/capacity, and the registration status — open, opens on a date, or closed. Card content SHALL have 1 em of left and right padding inside the card. Date and place SHALL be presented as a responsive multi-column layout rather than one long line, collapsing to fewer columns on narrow screens. The card layout SHALL render correctly whether or not a logo, subtitle, or location is present. Each upcoming tournament SHALL offer a Register action when the account has no active registration for it, or a Manage registration action when it does; both open the tournament detail page. Each tab SHALL show its own empty-state message when it lists nothing.

A discipline on a card SHALL be labelled by its name, never by its slug (`discipline-identity`). Names are longer than the codes they replace and a tournament MAY offer several disciplines whose names differ only in a trailing qualifier, so the discipline row on a card SHALL wrap across lines rather than truncate, overflow, or force the card wider, and SHALL remain legible on the narrowest supported screen.

#### Scenario: Open tournament listed with counts
- **WHEN** a fencer opens Fencer Home while a published upcoming tournament with two disciplines (18 of 25 taken, and 25 of 16 seats incl. queue) is open for registration
- **THEN** the tournament appears in the Open tab with its name, organizers, date, location, each discipline named with its numbers, an "open" status, and a Register button

#### Scenario: Disciplines named, not coded
- **WHEN** a card lists a tournament's disciplines
- **THEN** each is labelled by its name, and no slug appears on the card

#### Scenario: Many long discipline names wrap
- **WHEN** a card lists six disciplines whose names include trailing qualifiers, on a narrow screen
- **THEN** the discipline row wraps across lines, every name stays legible and untruncated, and the card does not widen or overflow

### Requirement: Tournament detail — information
The tournament detail page SHALL open, from the list, on an information screen that presents the tournament's full public information and does not itself contain the registration form. It SHALL show: name, subtitle when set, logo when set, date, location, organizer names, registration window, and three grouped sections. The disciplines section SHALL list each discipline by its name — never its slug (`discipline-identity`) — with its entry fee, its registered count as registered/capacity (or substitute-queue length when full), its optional when/where, and its optional ruleset shown as a short style name linking to the external ruleset document when a link is set. Several disciplines classified alike SHALL each be listed on their own line under their own name, with their own fee and their own count. A team discipline SHALL be listed in the same section, marked as a team event, with its per-team fee, its roster bounds, and its count stated in teams as entered/capacity (or waitlist length when full). When the tournament sets a team composition deadline and offers at least one team discipline, the deadline SHALL be stated in this section. The discounts section SHALL follow the disciplines section and SHALL list every discount the tournament configures, in configured order, each with its name, its condition stated as text, and its configured value — a fixed amount in each configured currency, or a percentage. The discounts section SHALL NOT show selection markers, since the information screen carries no selection, and SHALL be omitted entirely when the tournament configures no discounts. The other-actions section SHALL list non-purchasable activities — seminars, afterparties, after-sparrings, and accommodation — each with its optional when/where and remark. The information screen SHALL NOT mention gear lending or merch, and SHALL NOT show prices or quantity selectors for the other-actions section. When registration is available, the screen SHALL offer a control that opens the separate Register screen.

Where a discipline or an action carries any of its optional when/where/ruleset/remark text, that text SHALL be presented as a subordinate line beneath the row, one size down and in faded ink, with its parts separated by the spaced middle dot used elsewhere. The line SHALL NOT be introduced by a leading dash or any other bullet character: its indentation and weight already mark it as subordinate.

#### Scenario: Fencer reviews a tournament
- **WHEN** a fencer opens a tournament's detail from Fencer Home
- **THEN** they see the date, location, organizers, and each discipline under its name with its fee, registered/capacity count, and any when/where and ruleset link, on an information screen without the registration form

#### Scenario: Tiers listed separately
- **WHEN** a tournament offering two longsword disciplines with different capacities and fees is opened
- **THEN** both are listed on their own lines, each under its own name with its own fee and its own count

#### Scenario: Team discipline presented in teams
- **WHEN** a tournament offering a team discipline with capacity 8 and 5 teams entered is opened
- **THEN** that discipline is listed as a team event with its per-team fee, its roster bounds, and a count of 5/8 teams, alongside the composition deadline when one is set
