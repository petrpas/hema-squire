## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase-tabbed fencer table
The organizer console SHALL present phase tabs in the fixed order Setup, Load, Parsing, Matching on HR, Deduplication, Payments, Export, Teams, Queue. Every tab, including Setup, SHALL be clickable from every other tab. Selecting a phase tab SHALL change the console's URL to that phase and push a browser history entry, so that Back returns to the previously open phase and a reload reopens the phase on display. The Setup tab (step 0) SHALL present the tournament configuration — identity fields, titular organizers, disciplines, registration window, pricing, and the completeness checklist — instead of a fencer table. Teams and Queue SHALL likewise replace the fencer table with their own views, as fixed by `team-disciplines` and `seating-queue`. Each of the processing tabs SHALL show the full fencer list in the state after that operation, the base columns (No, Name, Nat., Club) plus phase-specific columns, the operation's parameter panel (general rules), and the log of manual edits belonging to that phase.

**Which phases are offered SHALL follow the tournament's features**, as fixed by `tournament-modes`. The Payments phase SHALL be offered only while the payments feature is on, and the Teams phase only while the team disciplines feature is on. The remaining phases SHALL always be offered, since they are what every tournament is made of. Whichever phases are offered SHALL keep the fixed order above; the mode removes phases, it never reorders them.

A phase the mode does not offer SHALL NOT be reachable by its URL either. Addressing it SHALL open the console on the phase it opens on by default rather than on an empty view, so that a bookmark saved before a feature was turned off still lands somewhere useful.

#### Scenario: Switching phases
- **WHEN** the organizer switches from Matching on HR to Payments
- **THEN** the table re-renders with payment columns and the Payments parameter panel and edits log, over the same fencer list, and the URL names the Payments phase

#### Scenario: Setup tab
- **WHEN** the organizer opens the Setup tab
- **THEN** the tournament configuration forms and completeness checklist are shown in place of the fencer table

#### Scenario: Returning to Setup
- **WHEN** the organizer is on any processing tab and clicks the Setup tab
- **THEN** the Setup phase opens; the tab's full visual extent accepts the click

#### Scenario: Back returns to the previous phase
- **WHEN** the organizer moves from Load to Parsing and presses Back
- **THEN** the Load phase is shown again

#### Scenario: Payments phase absent without the feature
- **WHEN** the organizer opens the console of a tournament whose payments feature is off
- **THEN** no Payments phase is offered, and the other phases its mode allows behave as usual

#### Scenario: Teams phase absent without the feature
- **WHEN** the organizer opens the console of a tournament whose team disciplines feature is off
- **THEN** no Teams phase is offered

#### Scenario: Stale bookmark to a hidden phase
- **WHEN** an organizer opens a saved URL naming the Payments phase of a tournament whose payments feature has since been turned off
- **THEN** the console opens on its default phase rather than on an empty Payments view

#### Scenario: Phase reappears with its feature
- **WHEN** the organizer turns the payments feature back on
- **THEN** the Payments phase is offered again in its fixed place between Deduplication and Export
